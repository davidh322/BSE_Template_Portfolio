# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# building Chassis
  

My first milestone for this project was just putting all the physical components together.  I built the frame of the car, attached the motors, attached the wheels, attached the batteries, attached the arduino, attached the motor controller and then i wired them all together.  One thing that was challenging was getting the perfboard, which i used to connect the motor controller and the IR sensor to the battery pack, to work correctly.  I didn't realize that i needed to create my own metal rails, I was under the assumption that, like a bread board, the perf board also has built in rails, but i was incorrect.  I have not yet been able to get the motors running-- i have a code but it isn't functional yet.  I have the IR sensor functioning correctly bu, but the mototrs are not moving they're just making a noise. moving forward i must figure out what the problem is that is stopping my motors from working, and once that happensI will be at my second milestone.
